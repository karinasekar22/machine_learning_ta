# machine_learning_ta
This project explores multiple machine learning approaches using the breast cancer dataset, including both supervised learning (Naive Bayes, Neural Network) and unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering). The goal is to classify tumor types (malignant/benign) and compare algorithm performance.
