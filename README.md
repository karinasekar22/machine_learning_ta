# machine_learning_ta
This project applies supervised learning methods to classify tumor types (malignant or benign) using the breast cancer dataset.
The algorithms explored include Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and a basic Neural Network model, implemented in Python with Scikit-learn.
Evaluation metrics include accuracy score and confusion matrix.
